# Adiuvare
A hearing disability assistance app for Android.
Done as part of a project in UCSC's Mobile App Development Class in Dec 2017.

Provides:
  Text-to-Speech functionality (for the speaking impaired)
    Translates input text into audible speech using Google's TTS API.
  Speech-to-Text functionality (for the hearing impaired)
    Translates audio into english text using Google's STT API.
  Speech Amplification (Listens and repeats at a louder volume)
    Records audio and repeats an amplified version once it is done listening.
    This segment was meant to amplify speaker microphone audio and playback using the user's earbuds, however the team could not figure out how to make the APP use the PHONE'S MICROPHONE rather than the EARBUD'S MICROPHONE.
    As a result it was reworked.
